# data-sync

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Single sync entry point
The system SHALL provide one CLI (`scripts/sync.js`, exposed as `npm run sync`) that fetches all remote data. No other script SHALL fetch remote data directly.

#### Scenario: Default run covers all leagues
- **WHEN** `npm run sync` is run with no flags
- **THEN** matches and fixtures are fetched for the active season for every league in `static/leagues.json`

#### Scenario: Scoped fetch
- **WHEN** `npm run sync -- --league=championship --season=2023-24 --type=matches` is run
- **THEN** only that league/season/type combination is fetched

#### Scenario: Historical backfill
- **WHEN** `npm run sync -- --from=2003-04` is run
- **THEN** every season from 2003-04 through the active season is fetched, respecting per-league data availability in `static/seasons-config.json`

### Requirement: Cache-gated by default with force override
Sync SHALL skip network calls when the TTL cache (`data/.cache/`, gitignored) is fresh, and SHALL bypass all cache gates when `--force` is passed.

#### Scenario: Fresh cache skips fetch
- **WHEN** sync runs and the cache entry for a (league, type, season) is within TTL
- **THEN** no network request is made for that target and the existing data file is untouched

#### Scenario: Force bypasses cache
- **WHEN** sync runs with `--force`
- **THEN** every selected target is fetched from the network regardless of cache freshness

### Requirement: Write safety
Sync MUST NOT delete or overwrite existing data with empty or null fetch results, and MUST NOT rewrite a data file whose content hash is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Empty fetch preserves existing data
- **WHEN** a fetcher returns null or an empty result for a season that has an existing data file
- **THEN** the existing file is preserved unchanged

#### Scenario: Unchanged content writes nothing
- **WHEN** fetched data hashes identically to the existing file
- **THEN** the file is not rewritten (cache timestamp only is refreshed) so commits stay quiet

### Requirement: No fabricated data
The repository SHALL NOT contain tooling that generates synthetic match results or standings. Structural season scaffolding (zeroed records at season rollover) is permitted.

#### Scenario: Fake-data generator removed
- **WHEN** the scripts directory is inspected
- **THEN** `generate-matches.js` does not exist and no script fabricates match results

### Requirement: Source data files are immutable
Sync SHALL write only data fetched from sources. It MUST NOT write derived data (e.g. standings computed from matches) — derivation happens in memory at render time (see `site-rendering`).

#### Scenario: Matches fetch does not touch standings
- **WHEN** sync fetches matches for a season
- **THEN** no standings file is created or modified
