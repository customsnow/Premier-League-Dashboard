# Architecture — Premier League Dashboard

## Overview

A single-page football statistics dashboard rendered from JSON data and one HTML template. The rendered page is a build artifact that never lives in the repo: dev serves it from memory, CI renders it at deploy time.

## Principles

1. **One writer per direction.** `sync` is the only thing that writes `data/`, and it writes *fetched* data only. `render` is the only thing that produces HTML, and only into `_site/` (gitignored). Nothing writes HTML at the repo root, ever.
2. **Pure rendering.** `composeData()` reads JSON into the `window.__DATA` object; `renderHTML(data, template)` is a string transform. Dev and CI call the same functions, so dev output cannot drift from deploys.
3. **Source data is immutable; derivation happens at render time.** Nothing writes computed data into `data/`. `composeData()` derives standings in memory (`scripts/utils/derive-standings.js`) for any (league, season) that has played matches but no standings file. An existing standings file always wins — official tables encode things derivation can't know (points deductions). Known limitation: ESPN date ranges include playoff finals, so derived gap-filler tables can slightly overcount games for playoff participants.
4. **Data is real or absent.** No fabricated match results or synthetic standings. The only generated *files* are season scaffolding — `scripts/handle-season-end.js` creates next-season standings with zeroed records and promotion/relegation movements at rollover (May 31). Structural, not results. A fake-data generator (`generate-matches.js`) existed once and was deliberately removed.
5. **Fetches are safe by construction.**
   - TTL cache gates API calls (`data/.cache/`, gitignored; active season 1 h, past seasons 7 d).
   - SHA-256 content hash gates file writes — unchanged data writes nothing, so commits stay quiet.
   - Empty/null fetches never clobber existing files.
   - Seasons before a league's ESPN availability (`static/seasons-config.json`) are skipped without a network call.

## Rendering

`composeData()` merges `static/*.json` (curated) with every `data/<league>/<type>/<season>.json` (fetched) into one object; `renderHTML()` injects it at the template's `/* __DATA_INJECTION_POINT__ */` marker and substitutes `{{ACTIVE_SEASON_SHORT}}`. Template compilation (not runtime fetch) avoids CORS issues on GitHub Pages; the page is self-contained except for team logos (`static/logos/`) and optional live-score calls the client makes directly to ESPN.

The dev server re-renders on every request (~30 ms), so freshness is structural — there is no cached artifact to go stale. It also strips the `/Premier-League-Dashboard` Pages base path so the same markup works locally.

The active season is computed from the current date (August → May rollover, `scripts/utils/active-season.js`); nothing in the repo hardcodes a season.

## CI

| Workflow | Trigger | Does | Commits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nightly-update.yml` | 2 AM UTC daily | `npm run sync` (season-end handler on May 31) | `data/` only |
| `season-end-update.yml` | May 31, manual | rollover scaffolding + validation | `data/`, `static/league-promotions.json` |
| `historical-fetch.yml` | manual | `sync --league=… --from=…` backfill | `data/` only |
| `deploy-pages.yml` | push to main, `workflow_run` after data workflows, manual | `npm run render` → `_site/` + `static/` → Pages | nothing |

Data workflows never build or commit HTML. Deploy renders fresh from the commit it ships. The `workflow_run` chaining exists because pushes made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't fire `on: push` workflows.

## History

v1 was a 332 KB monolithic HTML file with hardcoded data. v2 split data from presentation (template + JSON + build-to-root-index.html). v3 (current) removed the committed artifact entirely: unified sync, pure render library, in-memory dev, render-at-deploy.
